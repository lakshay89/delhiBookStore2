          The saga of DBS started in 1947, when Jeewan Kumar Ahuja, a young boy then, decided to move his family from Dera Ghazi Khan to Delhi. To support himself and his family, Jeewan starts a small business selling medical books, on foot or on a bicycle, to young medicos. Soon, the growing sales figure prompts him to think of expanding his business and he opens a small shop in the busiest by-lane in Old Delhi, in Nai Sarak.

        </p>
        <p>
         Soon, the shop becomes the Mecca for medical students, doctors, teachers and libraries of medical colleges and hospitals in India as well as neighboring countries. And, Delhi Book Store become the household name in the world of medical and non-medical books.
